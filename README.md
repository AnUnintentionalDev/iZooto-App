# iZooto-App

This is a project which I got from Datability Solutions i.e. iZooto as an assignment. This project is build on fullpage.js which is an awesome JS library.

## Assignment Work

I have received this project from Datability Solution Pvt. Ltd. on Friday afternoon. I have to use fullPage.js and there is a list of tasks which I
need to solve in this assignment and these are as follows.

Section 1 (Main)
Same as image

Section 2,3,4 ( Engage | Retarget | Retain )
ENGAGE. RETARGET. RETAIN Title or tab should remain sticky/fixed and highlight the active section respectively to its content on the scroll.

Section 5 (Why iZooto)
Every box should have hover effect to read content.

Section 6
Same as image

Section 7
